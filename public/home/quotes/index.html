      <p>The things we consider important are often undervalued by other
disciplines &hellip; One of the most important concepts in Statistics is that of missing data.
For most people it&rsquo;s easy to ignore because much of it is not
very visible.<br>&mdash; <em>Cyntha Struthers and Don McLeish</em> in a workshop in 2015</p>
<p>&hellip; in all the sciences, we&rsquo;ve got to make sure that we are supporting the
idea that they&rsquo;re not subject to politics, that they&rsquo;re not skewed by an
agenda, that, as I said before, we make sure that we go where the evidence
leads us.&quot; <br>&mdash; <em>Barack Obama</em>
We can&rsquo;t just learn what we want to know, but what we should know.
<br>&mdash; <em>Joseph R. Biden</em>
Often decisions about interventions must be made, even if based on limited
empirical evidence, and we should help decision-makers make sensible
decisions under clearly stated assumptions so that &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; of the
conclusion about the effects of some intervention can honestly weigh the
support for that conclusion. <br>&mdash; <em>Donald Rubin</em>
To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralysed by
hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can still
do for those who study it.  <br>&mdash; <em>Bertrand Russell</em>
Human History becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.
<br>&mdash; <em>H. G. Wells</em>
Would you rather know the chance of making an assertion of efficacy when the
treatment has no effect, or the chance that the treatment is effective?
<br>&mdash; <em>Frank H. Harrell</em>
Philosophical unification of the Bayesian and frequentist positions is not likely, nor desirable, since
each illuminates a different aspect of statistical inference. We can hope, however, that we will eventually
have a general methodological unification, with both
Bayesians and frequentists agreeing on a body of standard statistical procedures for general use.
<br>&mdash; <em>M. J. (Susie) Bayarri and James O. Berger</em> (2004) &ldquo;The Interplay of Bayesian and Frequentist Analysis.&rdquo; <em>Statistical Science</em> v. 19. (thanks to Hugh McCague)</p>
<p>The rubber hits the road where the data hits the code. <br>&mdash; <em>Janet McDougall</em>
The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in
everyone&rsquo;s backyard. <br>&mdash; <em>John W. Tukey,</em> who, incidentally, coined the terms
&lsquo;software&rsquo; and &lsquo;bit&rsquo;.
Once you know hierarchies exist, you see them everywhere <br>&mdash; <em>Ita Kreft and Jan
de Leeuw (1998) &ldquo;Introducing Multilevel Modeling&rdquo;</em>
Once you tune into ellipses, you will begin to see them everywhere &hellip; <br>&mdash;
<em>James McMullan</em>
&ldquo;. . . because of the exiguity of our thought which is able to realize only what it can represent to itself and leaves everything else in an obscurity . . .&rdquo; <br>&mdash;
<em>Marcel Proust</em>, Remembrance of Thing Past: The Prisoner
<span class="marginnote">
<img src='../pix/duchampwheel.png' alt="Bicycle Wheel">
Ellipse and conjugate axis generator &mdash; <em>Marcel Duchamp</em><br>
</span></p>
<p>I believe that the artist doesn&rsquo;t know what he does. I attach even more
importance to the spectator than to the artist. <br>&mdash; <em>Marcel Duchamp</em></p>
<p>I hate a liar more than I hate a thief. A thief is after my salary &ndash; a
liar is after my reality. <br>&mdash; <em>50 Cent</em>
No amount of experimentation will prove me right; a single experiment
can prove me wrong. <br>&mdash; <em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
<p>The best thing about being a statistician is that you get a license to poke
your nose into everyone else&rsquo;s business. <br>&mdash; (??)
The best thing about universities is individual freedom, the worst thing is
collective irresponsibility. <br>&mdash; <em>David Northrup</em>
Humanists believe that the world has a fixed number of mysteries, so that
when one is solved, our sense of wonder is diminished. Scientists believe
that the world has endless mysteries, so that when one is solved, there are
always new ones to ponder. <br>&mdash; <em>D. O. Hebb quoted by Steven Pinker</em>
Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague,
than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.
<br>&mdash; <em>John W. Tukey,</em> (1962), &ldquo;The future of data analysis.&rdquo; Annals of
Mathematical Statistics 33, 1-67.
A bad answer to a good question may be far better than a good answer to a bad
question. <br>&mdash; a graduate class extrapolating from Tukey&rsquo;s dictum.
It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers.
<br>&mdash; <em>James Thurber</em>
I have a lot of questions . . . but I don&rsquo;t know what they are. <br>&mdash; overheard
at the end of what must have been an inspiring lecture
The worst, i.e., most dangerous, feature of  &lsquo;accepting the null hypothesis&rsquo;
is the giving up of explicit uncertainty . . . Mathematics can sometimes be
put in such black-and-white terms, but our knowledge or belief about the
external world never can. <br>&mdash; <em>John W. Tukey.</em> (1991). &ldquo;The Philosophy of
Multiple Comparisons.&rdquo; Statistical Science 6, 100&ndash;116.
Where there is no uncertainty there cannot be truth. <br>&mdash; <em>Richard Feynman</em>
(confirmed by Bill Langford)
So far as the theories of mathematics are about reality, they are not
certain; so far as they are certain, they are not about reality.
<br>&mdash; <em>Albert Einstein</em>
Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd. - <em>Voltaire</em>

All models are wrong but, we hope, not as wrong as the ones we used earlier.

There are no routine statistical question; only questionable statistical

Data analysis is an aid to thinking and not a replacement for. <br>
&mdash; <em>Richard Shillington</em>
Methodology should never be allowed to displace intelligence. <br>&mdash; paraphrased
from <em>Leland Wilkinson,</em> I think
Another thing about fit indices is that they are used all too often as
substitutes for thinking. In most cases, statistical analysis should be not
about determining the &ldquo;best fitting&rdquo; model according to a single numerical
criterion. In any given research there hopefully are underlying substantive
theory and knowledge, the research hopefully is guided by research questions
and knowledge about control variables, there is a distinction between primary
and secondary interest, a single research often has elements of hypothesis
testing as well as exploration, etc. etc. Fit indices in the ?IC family are
useful only as a secondary type of summary information, but research
questions and existing  knowledge are more important.  <br>&mdash; <em>Tom Snijders</em>
If you try to estimate everything, you will end up estimating nothing. <br>&mdash; [I

Fishing for hypotheses is like throwing a dart at a wall and then drawing a
target around it. <br>&mdash;  <em>Andrée Monette</em>
When statistics are not based on strictly accurate calculations, they mislead
instead of guide. The mind easily lets itself be taken in by the false
appearance of exactitude which statistics retain in their mistakes, and
confidently adopts errors clothed in the form of mathematical truth.
<br>&mdash; <em>Alexis de Tocqueville</em> [With the benefit of a few centuries to reflect on this, we
appreciate that the accuracy of the calculations is only one of many
requirements to ensure that statistics guide and not mislead]
Causal interpretation of the results of regression analysis of observational
data is a risky business.  The responsibility rests entirely on the shoulders

If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will
scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will

<blockquote>
<p>Random: Washington-area teenagers have been overheard saying such things as:
&ldquo;Did you see that outfit she was wearing? That was so random!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who invited
those random kids to this party?&rdquo; &ldquo;I never watch the news on TV. It&rsquo;s too,
like, random.&rdquo; The adjective seems to mean &ldquo;serendipitous,&rdquo; but is more
value-neutral. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually rather specific the way students use it,&rdquo;
English teacher Patrick Welsh tells The Washington Post, adding &ldquo;the
brightest of the bright kids are the ones who tend to use it.&rdquo;
I have a soft spot for secret passageways, bookshelves that open into
silence, staircases that go down into a void, and hidden safes. I even have
one myself, but I won&rsquo;t tell you where. At the other end of the spectrum are
statistics which I hate with all my heart. <br>&mdash; <em>Luis Buñuel</em></p>

Being a statistician means never having to say you&rsquo;re certain <br>&mdash; ??
There&rsquo;ll be a time when not having strong opinions about anything will be
seen not as a character flaw, but as a virtue. <br>&mdash; <em>Alberto Cairo</em>
It has often and confidently been asserted, that man&rsquo;s origin can never be
known: but ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge:
it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively
assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.
<br>&mdash; <em>Charles Darwin</em>
One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are
stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with
doubt and indecision. <br>&mdash; <em>Bertrand Russell</em>
The methods of statistics turn art into science <br>&mdash; paraphrased from
<em>Arnold Zellner</em>
Statistics is an art struggling to be a science. <br>&mdash;  <em>Heather Krause</em>
A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco <br>&mdash; ?
A data scientist is a statistician who is useful <br>&mdash; <em>Hadley Wickham</em></p>
<p>A popular joke is that  &ldquo;a data scientist is a statistician who lives in San
Francisco,&rdquo; but Hadley Wickham, a Ph. D. statistician, floated a more cynical
take on Twitter: &ldquo;a data scientist is a statistician who is useful.&rdquo;
Statisticians are the guardians of statistical inference, and it is our
responsibility to educate practitioners about using models appropriately, and
the hazards of ignoring model assumptions when making inferences. But many
model assumptions are only truly met under idealized conditions, and thus, as
Box eloquently argued, one must think carefully about when statistical
inferences are valid. When they are not, statisticians are caught in the
awkward position, as Wickham suggests, of always saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. This position
can be dissatisfying.  <br>&mdash; <em>Ben Baumer</em> in &ldquo;A Data Science Course for
Undergraduates: Thinking with Data&rdquo;, March, 2015
The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence <br>&mdash; <em>Carl Sagan</em> and many many

A difference of evidence is not in itself evidence of a difference <br>&mdash; ??</p>
<p>The difference between &lsquo;significant&rsquo; and &rsquo;not significant&rsquo; is not itself

Statisticians learn not to be surprised by the improbable &mdash; which is usually

Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:

Statistical rituals largely eliminate statistical thinking in the social
sciences. Rituals are indispensable for identification with social groups,
but they should be the subject rather than the procedure of science.
<br>&mdash; <em>Gerd Gigerenzer</em>
&hellip; statistics is fraught with contextual issues, which is the nature of the
discipline, whereas often mathematics strips off the context in order to
abstract and generalize. <br>&mdash; <em>J. Michael Shaughnessy</em>
I&rsquo;ve worked in so many areas &mdash; I&rsquo;m sort of a dilettante. Basically, I&rsquo;m not
interested in doing research and I never have been. I&rsquo;m interested in
understanding, which is quite a different thing. And often to understand
something you have to work it out yourself because no one else has done it.
<br>&mdash; <em>David Blackwell</em>
&hellip; no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which from year to year, and
in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular
case in the light of his evidence and his ideas.
<br>&mdash; <em>Sir Ronald A. Fisher (1956) quoted in Gerd Gigerenzer (2004) &ldquo;Mindless Statistics&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do intelligent people engage in statistical rituals rather than in statistical thinking?
Every person of average intelligence can understand that <code>\(p(D|H)\)</code> is not the same as <code>\(p(H|D)\)</code>.
That this insight fades away when it comes to hypothesis testing suggests that the cause is
not intellectual but social and emotional. Here is a hypothesis:
The conflict between statisticians, both suppressed by and inherent in the textbooks,
has become internalized in the minds of researchers. The statistical ritual is a form of
conflict resolution, like compulsive hand washing, which makes it resistant to arguments.
<br>&mdash; <em>Gerd Gigerenzer (2004) &ldquo;Mindless Statistics&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&hellip; causal vocabulary was virtually prohibited [in Statistics] for more than
half a century. And when you prohibit speech, you prohibit thought and stifle principles,
methods, and tools.
<br>&mdash; <em>Judea Pearl (2018) &ldquo;The Book of Why&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In observational studies, it must be remembered that the issue of bias
reduction nearly always dominates the issue of variance reduction:
a precise estimate that is badly biased can be more deceptive than helpful,
and matched
sampling is a key tool for reducing this bias without compromising
the integrity or
objectivity of the study&rsquo;s design.
<br>&mdash; <em>Donald Rubin (2006) &ldquo;Matched Sampling for Causal Effects&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The special training statisticans receive in mapping real problems into
formal probability models, computing inferences from data and models,
and exploring the adequacy of these inferences, is not really part of any
other formal discipline, yet is often critical to the quality of
empirical research.
<br>&mdash; <em>Donald Rubin (1993) &ldquo;The Future of Statistics&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The only victories that leave no regret are those that are gained over ignorance.
<br>&mdash; <em>Napoléon Bonaparte</em></p>
<p>The only thing worse than fighting with your allies is fighting with no allies.
<br>&mdash; <em>Winston Churchill</em></p>
<p>I have a foreboding of an America in my children&rsquo;s or grandchildren&rsquo;s time &ndash; when
the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries
have slipped away to other countries;
when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can
even grasp the issues;
when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question
those in authority;
when, clutching our crystals and
nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical
faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what&rsquo;s true,
we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.</p>
<p>The dumbing down
of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media,
the 30-second
sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming,
credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially
a kind of celebration of ignorance. <br>&mdash; <em>Carl Sagan</em> (1995) <em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em> cited
on MSNBC, The 11th Hour, by Brian Williams, July 12, 2021.</p>
